# Counter

Shows how to make a button that modifies internal state - it increments a counter

## Instructions

These examples were built with [expo](https://expo.io/) and [spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago). 

 
* `npm install spago expo-cli --global`
* `spago install`
* `spago build`
* `npm install`
* `npm run start` or `npm run ios` or `npm run android` or `npm run web` (for web-based app preview)

## Code

The entry point for the app is in `App.js`. Note that the compiled PureScript code is imported, and then called in the `render` function.
